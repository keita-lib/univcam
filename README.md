(1)On GitHub, saved changes are called " commits ".

(2)Each " commit " has an associated commit message,
   which is a description "explaining" why a particular change" was made". 

(3)"Commit messages" capture the history of your changes, 
  so other "contributors" can understand "what youâ€™ve done and why".
